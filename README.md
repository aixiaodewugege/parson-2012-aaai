MATLAB code used for the empirical experiments in my paper:

Oliver Parson, Siddhartha Ghosh, Mark Weal, Alex Rogers. Non-intrusive Load Monitoring using Prior Models of General Appliance Types. In: 26th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Toronto, Canada. 2012.

The data file, 'aaai.mat' is a parsed version of the REDD data set, which I'm afraid I can't redistribute. I was hoping to release the script I used to create this data structure, but but I'm afraid I never got round to it before finishing my PhD. As far as I can see from my code, it looks like it creates a variable called 'loads', which is a cell array of houses, e.g. loads{1} contains a matrix for house 1. For each house, the first column of the matrix contains the household aggregate data, while the remaining columns contain the sub-metered data for various appliances, e.g. loads{1}(:,1) is an array containing the aggregate data for house 1, while loads{1}(:,2:) is a matrix containing the sub-metered data for house 1. I remember I also summed the two phases of aggregate power into a single feed, and also summed the two feeds where a single appliance is connected to both phases. I think I then resampled these feeds to a fixed sampling rate of 1 sample per minute.
